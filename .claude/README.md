This directory contains development documentation and context for Claude Code (or any AI assistant) to reference when working on the Basilisk project.

## Files

- **CLAUDE.md** - Main development guide containing:
  - Coding standards
  - Implementation roadmap
  - Important notes and gotchas
  - Future feature designs
  - Testing strategy

## Purpose

This documentation helps maintain consistency across development sessions by:
1. Preserving architectural decisions
2. Documenting coding standards
3. Tracking what's implemented vs. planned
4. Providing context for future development

## Usage

When working on Basilisk, reference `CLAUDE.md` to:
- Understand the project's coding standards
- See what features are implemented
- Check the priority of upcoming features
- Review design patterns to follow
- Avoid common pitfalls

## Updating

Keep `CLAUDE.md` up to date as the project evolves:
- Mark features as complete when implemented
- Add new learnings and gotchas
- Update the roadmap as priorities shift
